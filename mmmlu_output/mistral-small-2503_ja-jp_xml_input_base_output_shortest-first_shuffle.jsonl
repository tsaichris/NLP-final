Assuming the average molar mass of Mars' atmosphere is approximately 43.5 g/mol (a reasonable assumption for a CO2-dominated atmosphere):\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass} = n \\times \\text{Molar Mass} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass} = 5.23 \\times 10^{17} \\, \\text{moles} \\times 43.5 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass} = 2.27 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass} = 2.27 \\times 10^{17} \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\nAnswer: C", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 909, "completion_tokens": 678}, "model_name": "mistral-small-2503", "model": "mistral-small-2503", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--fb939e83-d65f-433b-b932-0fa6e3674f62-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 231, "output_tokens": 678, "total_tokens": 909}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}

A model with high bias performs poorly on both training and unseen data.\n\n3. **Effect of Infinite Data**:\n   - With an infinite number of training examples, the model can learn the true underlying distribution of the data more accurately.

For a pattern with 5 horizontal tangents and 2 vertical tangents, the ratio of the frequencies is 5:2.\n\n3. **Calculate the Vertical Frequency**: Given that the horizontal input frequency is 100 Hz, we can use the frequency ratio to find the vertical frequency. If the ratio is 5:2, then the vertical frequency \\( f_v \\) can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{f_h}{f_v} = \\frac{5}{2}\n   \\]\n   where \\( f_h \\) is the horizontal frequency (100 Hz). Solving for \\( f_v \\):\n   \\[\n   f_v = \\frac{2}{5} \\times f_h = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 \\, \\text{Hz} = 40 \\, \\text{Hz}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check the Options**: The calculated vertical frequency is 40 Hz, but this does not match any of the given options directly. However, the pattern and the ratio suggest that the vertical frequency should be a multiple of 40 Hz. The closest option that fits this pattern is 400 Hz, which is 10 times the calculated frequency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: B", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 577, "completion_tokens": 374}, "model_name": "mistral-small-2503", "model": "mistral-small-2503", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--8763ca68-b6ca-4efb-a07e-246e6ed708c7-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 203, "output_tokens": 374, "total_tokens": 577}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}

The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain. The posterior part of the corpus callosum is particularly important for connecting the visual areas of the brain.\n\n2. **Impact on Visual and Language Centers**: A stroke in this area can disrupt the connection between the visual centers (which process what we see) and the language centers (which process and produce language).

If they perceive inequity, it can lead to dissatisfaction. However, this theory does not directly address the ineffectiveness of financial incentives alone.\n\n- **B: 期待理論 (Expectancy Theory)** - This theory posits that an individual will be motivated to perform a task if they believe that their effort will lead to a certain performance, and that performance will lead to a desired outcome. If employees do not believe that increased effort will lead to better performance or that better performance will lead to the desired outcome (e.g., more money), they may not be motivated. This theory can explain why financial incentives alone might not work if employees do not see a clear link between effort and reward.\n\n- **C: 二要因理論 (Two-Factor Theory)** - This theory, proposed by Frederick Herzberg, suggests that there are certain factors in the workplace that cause job satisfaction, while a separate set of factors cause dissatisfaction. Financial rewards are considered hygiene factors, which can prevent dissatisfaction but do not necessarily lead to satisfaction. This theory can explain why financial incentives alone might not improve motivation and satisfaction.\n\n- **D: ERG理論 (ERG Theory)** - This theory, proposed by Clayton Alderfer, is an extension of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. It suggests that individuals have three core needs: existence, relatedness, and growth. Financial incentives might satisfy existence needs but may not address relatedness and growth needs, which are crucial for long-term motivation and satisfaction.\n\nGiven the scenario, the **Two-Factor Theory (二要因理論)** best explains why financial incentives alone did not improve motivation and satisfaction.
