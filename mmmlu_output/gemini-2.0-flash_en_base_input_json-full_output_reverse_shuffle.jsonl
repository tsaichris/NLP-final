We can use the equation frequency = (gyromagnetic ratio / 2π) * magnetic field strength. We need to find the nuclide whose gyromagnetic ratio satisfies this equation when the frequency is 115.5 MHz and the magnetic field is 20.0 T. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the gyromagnetic ratio: gyromagnetic ratio = (2π * frequency) / magnetic field strength. Plugging in the values, we get gyromagnetic ratio = (2π * 115.5 * 10^6 Hz) / 20.0 T ≈ 3.63 * 10^7 rad/(s*T). Now we need to compare this value to the known gyromagnetic ratios of the given nuclides. The gyromagnetic ratios (in MHz/T) are approximately: 31P: 17.25, 29Si: -8.46, 19F: 40.08, 17O: -5.77. Multiplying these by 2π gives the gyromagnetic ratio in rad/(s*T) per Tesla. So, we have 31P: 1.08 * 10^8, 29Si: -5.32 * 10^7, 19F: 2.52 * 10^8, 17O: -3.63 * 10^7. Dividing the calculated gyromagnetic ratio (3.63 * 10^7) by the magnetic field (20 T) gives us approximately 1.815 MHz/T. Multiplying this by 2π gives us 1.14 * 10^7 rad/(s*T). Comparing this to the gyromagnetic ratios of the nuclides, we see that 17O has a gyromagnetic ratio of -5.77 MHz/T, which is closest to the calculated value when considering the magnetic field strength. However, the question asks which nuclide has an NMR frequency of 115.5 MHz in a 20.0 T magnetic field. We can calculate the expected frequency for each nuclide using the formula: frequency = (gyromagnetic ratio / 2π) * magnetic field strength. For 19F, frequency = (40.08 MHz/T / 2π) * 20.0 T = 127.3 MHz. For 31P, frequency = (17.25 MHz/T / 2π) * 20.0 T = 54.8 MHz. For 29Si, frequency = (-8.46 MHz/T / 2π) * 20.0 T = -26.9 MHz. For 17O, frequency = (-5.77 MHz/T / 2π) * 20.0 T = -18.4 MHz. The closest frequency to 115.5 MHz is 127.3 MHz for 19F. However, the question asks which nuclide has an NMR frequency of 115.5 MHz. Let's re-examine the gyromagnetic ratios. We are looking for a gyromagnetic ratio such that (gyromagnetic ratio / 2π) * 20.0 T = 115.5 MHz. This means gyromagnetic ratio = (115.5 * 10^6 * 2π) / 20 = 3.63 * 10^7 rad/(s*T). Dividing by 2π gives 5.77 MHz/T. The closest value is 17O at -5.77 MHz/T. However, the frequency would be negative. Let's check 19F again. (40.08 MHz/T / 2π) * 20 T = 127.3 MHz. This is close. Let's check 31P. (17.25 MHz/T / 2π) * 20 T = 54.8 MHz. Let's check 29Si. (-8.46 MHz/T / 2π) * 20 T = -26.9 MHz.

Converting GHz to Hz and G to Tesla, we have ν = 9.5 x 10^9 Hz and B = 0.3224 T. Using h = 6.626 x 10^-34 Js and μB = 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T, we can solve for g: g = hν / (μB B) = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js * 9.5 x 10^9 Hz) / (9.274 x 10^-24 J/T * 0.3224 T) = 2.092. The closest answer is 2.005, but let's use the average field value to calculate g. g = hν / (μB B) = (6.626e-34 * 9.5e9) / (9.274e-24 * 0.3224) = 2.092. The closest value is 2.005, but it's not very close. Let's try using the Breit-Rabi equation. However, since we are given the resonant field positions, we can estimate the g value by using the center of the spectrum. The center is (3074+3374)/2 = 3224 G. Then g = hν / (μB B) = (6.626e-34 * 9.5e9) / (9.274e-24 * 0.3224) = 2.092. The closest answer is 2.005, but it's not very close. Let's assume the g value is around 2.00. Then B = hν / (gμB) = (6.626e-34 * 9.5e9) / (2.00 * 9.274e-24) = 0.338 T = 3380 G. The difference between 3380 and 3224 is 156 G. The hyperfine splitting is 100 G. So the g value should be close to 2.00. Let's try g = 2.005. B = (6.626e-34 * 9.5e9) / (2.005 * 9.274e-24) = 0.337 T = 3370 G. The difference between 3370 and 3224 is 146 G.

However, the question mentions a straight line of 130, which is likely the cathode characteristic. The gate-source resistance is the total resistance minus the cathode resistance, so R_gs = 450 - 130 = 320 ohms. This is not among the options. The question is likely asking for the gate source resistance required to limit the gate power dissipation to 0.5W when the gate source voltage is 15V. The power dissipated in the gate is P = I^2 * R = V^2 / R, where R is the total resistance in the gate circuit. We are given V = 15V and P = 0.5W. Thus, R = V^2 / P = 15^2 / 0.5 = 225 / 0.5 = 450 ohms. The cathode characteristic is a straight line of 130 ohms, which means the cathode resistance is 130 ohms. The gate-source resistance is the total resistance minus the cathode resistance, so R_gs = 450 - 130 = 320 ohms. This is not among the options. Let's assume the 130 is a typo and should be 13. Then R_gs = 450 - 13 = 437 ohms. This is still not among the options. Let's assume the question is asking for the resistance needed to limit the current to a value that results in 0.5W power dissipation. P = VI, so I = P/V = 0.5/15 = 0.0333 A. Then R = V/I = 15/0.0333 = 450 ohms. If we subtract the 130 ohms, we get 320 ohms. If we assume the 130 is a typo and should be 13, then we get 437 ohms. Let's assume the question meant to say the gate current is 130 mA. Then the voltage drop across the gate source resistance is V = IR = 0.13 * R. The power dissipated is P = I^2 * R = (0.13)^2 * R = 0.5. So R = 0.5 / (0.13)^2 = 0.5 / 0.0169 = 29.58 ohms. This is not among the options. Let's assume the 130 is the resistance of the SCR gate. Then the total resistance is R = V^2/P = 15^2/0.5 = 450. The gate source resistance is R_gs = 450 - 130 = 320. This is not among the options. Let's assume the 130 is the voltage drop across the SCR gate. Then the voltage drop across the gate source resistance is 15 - 130 = -115. This is not possible. Let's assume the 130 is the current in mA. Then I = 0.13 A. The resistance is R = V/I = 15/0.13 = 115.38 ohms.
