If we assume dim(W) > 1 instead, then dim(V) < dim(W). If T is injective, then dim(V) <= dim(W). However, if dim(V) < dim(W), it does not necessarily mean that T is injective. For example, consider the zero transformation T(v) = 0 for all v in V. Then the kernel of T is V, so dim(ker(T)) = dim(V). By the rank-nullity theorem, dim(V) = dim(ker(T)) + dim(Im(T)).

Then T(v) = 0 for all v in V. Thus, ker(T) = V, and T is injective if and only if V is the zero vector space.

Since Im(T) is a subspace of V and dim(Im(T)) = dim(V) = n, we must have Im(T) = V. Thus, T is surjective. Since T is both injective and surjective, T is a bijection.

This group is exposed to the chemical waste, so it's not a good control group.\n\nOption B: Children not exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL. This group is not exposed to the chemical waste and does not have ALL, making it a suitable control group to compare against the group exposed to the chemical waste.\n\nOption C: Children from the hospital’s outpatient clinic who do not suffer from ALL. This group might be different from the general population in terms of health status, so it might not be the best control group. Also, it doesn't explicitly mention whether they are exposed to the chemical waste or not.\n\nOption D: Children not exposed to the chemical waste who suffer from ALL. This group has ALL but is not exposed to the chemical waste. This group is not suitable as a control group because the study is trying to determine if the chemical waste *causes* ALL.\n\nTherefore, the best control group is children not exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL.\n\nAnswer: B", "response_metadata": {"prompt_feedback": {"block_reason": 0, "safety_ratings": []}, "finish_reason": "STOP", "model_name": "gemini-2.0-flash", "safety_ratings": []}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--1f853810-b49a-4369-ac03-e4d71d605890-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 257, "output_tokens": 314, "total_tokens": 571, "input_token_details": {"cache_read": 0}}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}

Let's consider the extreme case where the sidereal day is slightly shorter than the orbital period, say 99 Earth days.\n\n1/Solar Day = 1/99 - 1/100 = (100 - 99) / 9900 = 1/9900\n\nSolar Day = 9900 Earth days.\n\nIf the sidereal day is slightly longer than the orbital period, say 101 Earth days.\n\n1/Solar Day = 1/100 - 1/101 = (101 - 100) / 10100 = 1/10100\n\nSolar Day = 10100 Earth days.\n\nSince the sidereal day is exactly 100 Earth days, the solar day is theoretically infinite. However, given the options, the closest answer would be a very long day. Since the planet rotates in the prograde direction, the solar day will be longer than the sidereal day. The only option that is longer than 100 Earth days is about 200 Earth days.\n\nAnswer: C", "response_metadata": {"prompt_feedback": {"block_reason": 0, "safety_ratings": []}, "finish_reason": "STOP", "model_name": "gemini-2.0-flash", "safety_ratings": []}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--e21b63ad-4711-4225-b759-7947e4cf1264-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 202, "output_tokens": 455, "total_tokens": 657, "input_token_details": {"cache_read": 0}}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}

This is closest to 27 G if we consider some ring puckering.\n\nHowever, let's consider the Karplus equation: aβ = A cos^2(θ) where A is between 30 and 50 G.\n\nIf we use A = 40 G, then aβ = 40 G * cos^2(57.5°) = 40 G * 0.2887 = 11.55 G.\n\nIf we use A = 45 G, then aβ = 45 G * cos^2(57.5°) = 45 G * 0.2887 = 12.99 G.\n\nThe closest answer is 27 G, but it's not very close. Let's re-examine the geometry. The dihedral angle is between the p orbital and the C-H bond. If the HCH angle is 115, then the angle between the C-H bond and the bisector is 115/2 = 57.5. The angle between the bisector and the C-C bond is (180-115)/2 = 32.5. So the dihedral angle is 90 - 32.5 = 57.5.\n\nLet's assume the dihedral angle is actually 30 degrees. Then aβ = 50 G * cos^2(30) = 50 G * (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 50 G * 3/4 = 37.5 G.\n\nLet's assume the dihedral angle is actually 60 degrees. Then aβ = 50 G * cos^2(60) = 50 G * (1/2)^2 = 50 G * 1/4 = 12.5 G.\n\nThe closest answer is still 27 G.\n\nAnswer: B", "response_metadata": {"prompt_feedback": {"block_reason": 0, "safety_ratings": []}, "finish_reason": "STOP", "model_name": "gemini-2.0-flash", "safety_ratings": []}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--5116e6c9-8f1f-4958-98a4-a1aea7a1d1b3-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 180, "output_tokens": 893, "total_tokens": 1073, "input_token_details": {"cache_read": 0}}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}

While relevant in general, it doesn't directly explain why stores *open* near a mall.\n*   **C) Complementarity:** Complementarity refers to the idea that two places can benefit from each other if they offer different goods or services. While some new stores might offer complementary goods, the primary reason for opening near a mall is to capitalize on the existing customer base.\n*   **D) Movement bias:** Movement bias refers to the tendency for people to move in certain directions or along certain routes. This doesn't directly explain why stores open near a mall.\n\nThe gravity concept best explains the phenomenon of new stores opening around a large shopping mall. The mall acts as a large \"mass\" attracting customers, and the new stores benefit from this attraction.\n\nAnswer: A", "response_metadata": {"prompt_feedback": {"block_reason": 0, "safety_ratings": []}, "finish_reason": "STOP", "model_name": "gemini-2.0-flash", "safety_ratings": []}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--5a826758-ff60-4a04-8be2-441da52a9dc1-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 145, "output_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 396, "input_token_details": {"cache_read": 0}}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}

They believed that formalism presented legal reasoning as a purely objective and mechanical process, where judges simply apply pre-existing rules to facts to reach a predetermined outcome. Realists argued that this view was unrealistic and that judges' personal beliefs, biases, and policy preferences inevitably influence their decisions. By portraying legal reasoning as a purely logical exercise, formalism, according to the realists, obscured the role of the judge's discretion and policy choices in shaping the law.

This view is hostile to the idea of universal human rights, which are supposed to apply to all people regardless of their cultural background. We need to find the strongest argument *against* this hostility.\n\n*   **A) Utilitarianism:** Utilitarianism focuses on maximizing overall happiness or well-being. While it *could* be used to argue for certain rights if they lead to greater happiness, it's not inherently opposed to ethical relativism. A utilitarian could argue that respecting cultural norms, even if they seem to violate human rights, might lead to the greatest overall happiness in a particular society.\n\n*   **B) Communitarianism:** Communitarianism emphasizes the importance of community and social context in shaping moral values. This perspective is actually *more* aligned with ethical relativism, as it suggests that moral obligations arise from one's membership in a particular community. Therefore, it wouldn't be a strong argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights.\n\n*   **C) Cognitivism:** Cognitivism, in ethics, is the view that moral statements express beliefs that can be true or false. This is in direct opposition to ethical relativism, which often implies that moral statements are merely expressions of opinion or cultural norms, not objective truths. If moral statements can be true or false, then there is a basis for arguing that certain actions are *objectively* wrong, regardless of cultural context, thus supporting universal human rights.\n\n*   **D) Positivism:** Positivism, especially in legal philosophy, emphasizes that laws are valid because they are created by legitimate authorities, not because they are inherently moral. This view doesn't necessarily challenge ethical relativism's hostility to human rights.\n\nTherefore, cognitivism provides the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights because it posits that moral truths exist independently of cultural norms.\n\nAnswer: C", "response_metadata": {"prompt_feedback": {"block_reason": 0, "safety_ratings": []}, "finish_reason": "STOP", "model_name": "gemini-2.0-flash", "safety_ratings": []}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--faa0918a-6d3e-4ee3-bf57-8daa4c3c7b53-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 153, "output_tokens": 400, "total_tokens": 553, "input_token_details": {"cache_read": 0}}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}
