Fuller's 'inner morality of law' is not primarily about rejecting this principle but rather about the internal principles that make law effective and just.\n\n2. **An Aquinian concept of natural law**: Thomas Aquinas's natural law theory posits that there are moral principles that are inherent in nature and can be discovered through reason.
