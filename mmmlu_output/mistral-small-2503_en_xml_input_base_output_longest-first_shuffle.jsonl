The nuclear magnetic moment of deuterium is approximately 1/6.5 of that of hydrogen.\n\n5. **Calculating the Hyperfine Value for C6D6•-**: Given the hyperfine splitting constant for C6H6•- is 0.375 mT, the value for C6D6•- can be estimated by dividing by the ratio of the nuclear magnetic moments:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hyperfine value for C6D6•-} = \\frac{0.375 \\text{ mT}}{6.5} \\approx 0.0577 \\text{ mT}\n   \\]\n   Converting this to Gauss (1 mT = 10 G):\n   \\[\n   0.0577 \\text{ mT} \\times 10 = 0.577 \\text{ G}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Matching with Options**: The closest value to 0.577 G among the given options is 0.58 G.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: D", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 165, "total_tokens": 660, "completion_tokens": 495}, "model_name": "mistral-small-2503", "model": "mistral-small-2503", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--4f4f01ad-9fa2-4382-a0f8-be57ac2f87bc-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 165, "output_tokens": 495, "total_tokens": 660}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}

This means that periods of high volatility are followed by periods of high volatility, and periods of low volatility are followed by periods of low volatility.\n\n4. **Volatility affecting returns (iv)**:\n   - In a standard GARCH(1,1) model, volatility is modeled as a separate process that affects the variance of returns but does not directly affect the mean returns.

G.E. Moore is known for his work in metaethics, particularly his open-question argument. This argument is central to his view on the nature of ethical terms and the definition of \"good.\"\n\nMoore argued that ethical terms like \"good\" are simple, unanalyzable concepts. He believed that the question of how \"good\" is to be defined is a fundamental one in ethics because it addresses the very nature of moral properties. This question is central to his philosophical inquiries and is a key aspect of his ethical theory.\n\nGiven this context, the most fundamental question in all of ethics according to Moore is:\n\nAnswer: C", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 152, "total_tokens": 303, "completion_tokens": 151}, "model_name": "mistral-small-2503", "model": "mistral-small-2503", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--125317be-4bf3-420f-b21c-7c671c6ae376-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 152, "output_tokens": 151, "total_tokens": 303}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}

The recognition of human rights on an international scale emphasized the inherent rights of individuals, which aligns with the principles of natural law.\n\n- **Option B: The Depression of the 1930s.** While the Great Depression had significant economic and social impacts, it did not directly contribute to the revival of natural law.

It often treats legal reasoning as a form of syllogistic reasoning, where a general rule is applied to a specific case to reach a conclusion.\n\n2. **American Realists**: This school of legal thought argues that legal rules are not as fixed or determinate as formalists suggest. They believe that judges have a significant role in shaping the law through their decisions, which can be influenced by various factors beyond just the application of formal rules.\n\n3. **Authority of the Judge**: American realists argue that judges have the authority to make law, not just apply it. This means that judicial decisions are crucial in shaping legal principles and can be influenced by the judge's interpretation and discretion.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **A**: \"Formalism treats legal reasoning as syllogistic reasoning.\" This is true, but it does not directly address why American realists would argue that formalism devalues the authority of the judge.\n\n- **B**: \"Judicial decisions are less important than legislation.\" This is not accurate. American realists actually emphasize the importance of judicial decisions in shaping the law.\n\n- **C**: \"Judges generally base their decisions on formal logic.\" This is more aligned with formalism, not realism. Realists argue that judges use a broader range of considerations beyond formal logic.\n\n- **D**: \"The structure of legal reasoning is flawed.\" This is not the main argument of American realists. They focus more on the role of judges in making law rather than the structure of legal reasoning being flawed.\n\nThe key point is that American realists argue that formalism devalues the authority of the judge to make law because formalism treats legal reasoning as purely logical and rule-based, thereby limiting the judge's discretion and role in shaping the law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 588, "completion_tokens": 415}, "model_name": "mistral-small-2503", "model": "mistral-small-2503", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--f19c61db-7170-4386-8b41-f0918d205610-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 173, "output_tokens": 415, "total_tokens": 588}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}

He believed that such laws could not be considered valid law because they failed to meet the internal morality of law.\n\n2. **Hart's Response**: Hart, on the other hand, argued that the validity of a law is determined by its source and not its content.
