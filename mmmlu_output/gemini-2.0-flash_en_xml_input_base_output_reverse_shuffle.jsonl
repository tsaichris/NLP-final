Thus, $|\\text{Im}(\\phi)|$ must divide 12.\nAlso, $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$ is isomorphic to $G/\\text{ker}(\\phi)$, so $|\\text{Im}(\\phi)| = |G|/|\\text{ker}(\\phi)| = 6/|\\text{ker}(\\phi)|$. Thus, $|\\text{Im}(\\phi)|$ must divide 6.\nTherefore, $|\\text{Im}(\\phi)|$ must divide both 6 and 12, so $|\\text{Im}(\\phi)|$ must divide $\\gcd(6, 12) = 6$.\nThe possible values for $|\\text{Im}(\\phi)|$ are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\nSince $|\\text{Im}(\\phi)|$ must divide 6, it cannot be 12.

If dim(W) < 1, then dim(W) must be 0. This implies W is the zero vector space. If dim(W) = 0, then T(v) = 0 for all v in V. Thus, T is the zero transformation. If dim(V) > 0, then the kernel of T is V, which is not just the zero vector. Therefore, T is not injective. If dim(V) = 0, then V is also the zero vector space, and T is injective. However, the statement says dim(V) < dim(W), so dim(V) must be 0. In this case, T is injective. However, the condition dim(W) < 1 is unusual. Let's assume the question meant dim(V) < dim(W).\nIf dim(V) < dim(W), it is possible for T to be injective. For example, consider V = R and W = R^2, and T(x) = (x, 0). Then T is injective.

By the rank-nullity theorem, rank(T) + nullity(T) = dim(V). Since nullity(T) = 0, rank(T) = dim(V) = n. Since the rank of T is n, the image of T is an n-dimensional subspace of V.

This is also true. Kernel methods, like using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, implicitly map the data into a higher-dimensional feature space. In this higher-dimensional space, the data may be linearly separable, even if it wasn't in the original space.

Let's analyze each theory to see which best explains this outcome.\n\n*   **Two-factor theory (Herzberg):** This theory distinguishes between hygiene factors (like salary) and motivators (like achievement, recognition). Hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction, but don't necessarily lead to motivation. If the employees' dissatisfaction stemmed from other hygiene factors or a lack of motivators, the financial incentive alone wouldn't be effective.\n\n*   **Equity theory:** This theory focuses on employees' perceptions of fairness in the workplace. If employees believe the incentive program is unfairly distributed or that their efforts are not adequately rewarded compared to others, it could lead to demotivation. However, the question doesn't explicitly mention issues of fairness.\n\n*   **Expectancy theory:** This theory states that motivation is determined by expectancy (belief that effort will lead to performance), instrumentality (belief that performance will lead to rewards), and valence (the value of the rewards). If employees don't believe their efforts will lead to a bonus (low expectancy), or if they don't value the bonus (low valence), or if they don't believe the bonus is tied to their performance (low instrumentality), the incentive program will fail.\n\n*   **ERG theory (Alderfer):** This theory simplifies Maslow's hierarchy of needs into Existence, Relatedness, and Growth. While it could be argued that the financial incentive addresses Existence needs, it doesn't necessarily address Relatedness or Growth needs, which could explain the lack of motivation. However, two-factor theory and expectancy theory are more directly relevant.\n\nConsidering the scenario, the two-factor theory provides the most direct explanation. The financial incentive addresses a hygiene factor, but doesn't necessarily address the motivators that truly drive job satisfaction and motivation. Expectancy theory could also be applicable if employees didn't value the bonus or didn't believe they could achieve it.
