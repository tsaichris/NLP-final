In this case, frequency = 198.52 MHz = 198.52 x 10^6 Hz and magnetic field strength is proportional to the spectrometer frequency, so we use 750 MHz as a proxy for the magnetic field strength. Therefore, gamma = (198.52 x 10^6 Hz) / (750 x 10^6 Hz / T) = 0.264693333 T^-1 s^-1 * 10^9 = 2.64693333 x 10^8 T^-1 s^-1. However, the magnetic field strength is not directly 750 MHz, but proportional to it. The correct formula is gamma = frequency / B0, where B0 is the magnetic field strength. We are given the NMR frequency of 23Na in a 750 MHz spectrometer. The relationship between the NMR frequency (v) and the magnetic field strength (B0) is given by v = (gamma/2pi) * B0. We need to find gamma. We can rearrange the formula to gamma = 2pi * v / B0. However, we are not given B0 directly. We are given the spectrometer frequency, which is proportional to B0. The ratio of the nucleus frequency to the spectrometer frequency is constant. So, we can use the formula gamma = 2*pi*frequency/B0. Since the spectrometer frequency is proportional to B0, we can say that the ratio of the nucleus frequency to the spectrometer frequency is constant. Therefore, gamma = 2*pi*198.52e6 / B0. We know that the proton frequency in the same spectrometer is 750 MHz. The magnetogyric ratio of proton is 26.75 x 10^7 T-1 s-1. So, 750e6 = (26.75e7 / 2pi) * B0. Therefore, B0 = 750e6 * 2pi / 26.75e7 = 17.61 T.
