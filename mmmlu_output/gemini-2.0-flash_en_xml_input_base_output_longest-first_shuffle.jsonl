Since the radical is assumed to be flat, the angle between the bisector of the HCH angle and the C-C bond is (180 - 115)/2 = 65/2 = 32.5°.  The dihedral angle θ is then 90 - 32.5 = 57.5°.\n\nTherefore, aβ = B cos^2(57.5°)\n\nAssuming B = 5 mT, aβ = 5 * cos^2(57.5°) = 5 * (0.5373)^2 = 5 * 0.2887 = 1.44 mT.\n\nHowever, a more common value for B is around 50 G, which is 5 mT.

The other options are in mT.\n\nLet's reconsider the geometry. If the HCH angle is 115°, then the angle between the C-H bond and the p orbital is 57.5°.  However, there are two such angles, so we should consider the average.\n\nLet's assume B is around 5 mT. Then aβ = 5 * cos^2(57.5) = 1.44 mT.

This is closest to 27 G, but still not very close.\n\nLet's try to estimate the dihedral angle differently. If the HCH angle is 115°, then the angle between the C-C bond and the bisector of the HCH angle is (180-115)/2 = 32.5°. The dihedral angle is then 90 - 32.5 = 57.5°.\n\nIf we assume the HCH angle is smaller, say 109.5°, then the angle between the C-C bond and the bisector is (180-109.5)/2 = 35.25°. The dihedral angle is then 90 - 35.25 = 54.75°.\n\nThen aβ = 5 * cos^2(54.75) = 5 * (0.576)^2 = 5 * 0.3317 = 1.66 mT.\n\nIf we assume B = 50 G, then aβ = 50 * cos^2(54.75) = 50 * 0.3317 = 16.58 G.\n\nThe closest answer is 4.6 mT. Let's see if we can get that value.\n\nIf aβ = 4.6 mT, then cos^2(θ) = 4.6/5 = 0.92. Then cos(θ) = sqrt(0.92) = 0.959. Then θ = arccos(0.959) = 16.4°. This is not a reasonable angle.\n\nLet's try aβ = 4.6 mT and B = 50 G. Then cos^2(θ) = 4.6/50 = 0.092. Then cos(θ) = sqrt(0.092) = 0.303.

Sharing the mean vector would lead to a simpler model, potentially underfitting if the classes are truly different. Allowing different means increases model complexity, potentially overfitting if the training data is limited.\n\nB) Assuming full covariance matrices allows the model to capture correlations between features within each class. Diagonal covariance matrices assume features are independent within each class, simplifying the model. Using full covariance matrices increases model complexity and the risk of overfitting, especially with high-dimensional data and limited samples. Diagonal covariance matrices reduce complexity and the risk of overfitting, but may underfit if features are truly correlated. This option directly impacts the model's flexibility and thus the underfitting/overfitting trade-off.\n\nC) The method used to learn class centers (Maximum Likelihood or Gradient Descent) is an optimization detail and doesn't fundamentally change the model's structure or complexity. It mainly affects the efficiency of learning, not the underfitting/overfitting trade-off.\n\nD) Using equal class priors or estimating them from the data affects the decision boundary, but it's less impactful on the model's overall complexity compared to the covariance structure.

If the employees don't believe their effort will lead to a bonus, or they don't value the bonus, or they don't believe the bonus is tied to performance, then the incentive program would fail. This is a plausible explanation.\n\n*   **Two-factor theory (Herzberg):** This theory distinguishes between hygiene factors (like salary) and motivators (like achievement and recognition). Hygiene factors can prevent dissatisfaction, but they don't necessarily lead to motivation. The incentive program addresses a hygiene factor (salary), so the theory predicts it might prevent dissatisfaction, but not necessarily increase motivation. This is also a plausible explanation.\n\n*   **Equity theory:** This theory suggests that employees are motivated when they perceive fairness in the ratio of their inputs (effort, skills) to their outputs (pay, recognition) compared to others. If employees feel the incentive program is unfairly distributed or doesn't adequately compensate their efforts compared to others, it could fail to motivate. This is also a plausible explanation.\n\n*   **ERG theory:** This theory simplifies Maslow's hierarchy of needs into Existence, Relatedness, and Growth needs.
