If \\( r \\) divides \\( m \\) and \\( s \\) divides \\( n \\), then \\( Z_m \\) has a subgroup \\( Z_r \\) and \\( Z_n \\) has a subgroup \\( Z_s \\).\n\nHowever, the direct sum \\( Z_m + Z_n \\) does not necessarily have a subgroup isomorphic to \\( Z_r + Z_s \\) just because \\( r \\) divides \\( m \\) and \\( s \\) divides \\( n \\).

In this case, V and W are both the zero vector space, and any linear map between them is the zero map, which is injective.

By the rank-nullity theorem, rank(T) + nullity(T) = dim(V). Since nullity(T) = 0 (because T is injective), rank(T) = dim(V). This means T maps V onto itself, making T surjective.

Mars has a significant axial tilt, similar to Earth, which means it experiences seasons.\n\n3. **Seasonal Effects**: During the winter in the southern hemisphere of Mars, the rover would be in a position where it might need to tilt to maximize solar energy intake, as the sun would be lower in the sky.

This role is crucial because it highlights the broader social and cultural factors that influence military recruitment and retention.\n\n2. **Gender and Strategy**: The concept of the \"soldier's mother\" confirms the role of gender in military strategies.

They are actively involved in the process of recruitment and retention. Their support and encouragement are essential for maintaining a strong military force. This active participation is often overlooked in traditional security analyses, which tend to focus more on the soldiers themselves rather than the broader societal support system.\n\n4. **Critical Interpretation**: The \"soldier's mother\" is important because it provides a critical lens through which to view security.

He argues that individuals should be treated as equals in terms of their opportunities and resources, and that differences in outcomes should be based on individual choices rather than luck.\n\n- **C: 平等よりも自由の方が重要だから (Freedom is more important than equality)** - Dworkin does not prioritize freedom over equality. Instead, he seeks to balance the two, ensuring that individuals have equal opportunities and resources while also respecting their freedom to make choices.\n\n- **D: 国家は個人間の平等の最良の調停者だから (The state is the best mediator of equality among individuals)** - While Dworkin may support the role of the state in ensuring equality, this is not the primary reason he supports liberal egalitarianism.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 534, "completion_tokens": 327}, "model_name": "mistral-small-2503", "model": "mistral-small-2503", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--9f283f48-a67a-4650-8558-5823b2a7529f-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 207, "output_tokens": 327, "total_tokens": 534}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}

This leads to a constant state of war, where everyone is against everyone else.\n\nHobbes argues that the first law of nature is to seek peace and to lay down the right to all things, including the life of others. This is because in a state of constant war, no one can enjoy the fruits of their labor or live in security.

The Supreme Court ruled that the law was unconstitutional, establishing a woman's right to choose an abortion.\n\n2. **Majority Opinion**: The majority opinion, written by Justice Harry Blackmun, argued that the right to privacy, which is implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, encompasses a woman's decision to have an abortion. This was a significant legal interpretation that expanded the concept of privacy rights.\n\n3. **Controversy**: The decision was controversial because it effectively legalized abortion nationwide and established a framework for evaluating abortion laws based on the trimester of pregnancy.

He believed that the social contract is an idealized agreement that people would enter into if they were to create a just and legitimate society.\n\nGiven these considerations, the philosopher who claimed that the social contract is a hypothetical construction of reason is:\n\nAnswer: D", "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 167, "total_tokens": 423, "completion_tokens": 256}, "model_name": "mistral-small-2503", "model": "mistral-small-2503", "finish_reason": "stop"}, "type": "ai", "id": "run--235c2632-b45a-4929-a599-d93d90a7e115-0", "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 167, "output_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 423}, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": []}}
