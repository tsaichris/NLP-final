Instead, we can try to find the zeros by plugging in values from the finite field Z_5.\n\nThe elements of Z_5 are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. We can plug each of these values into the polynomial and see if it equals 0.\n\nLet's start with x = 0:\n\n(0)^5 + 3(0)^3 + (0)^2 + 2(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\nSo, x = 0 is a zero of the polynomial.\n\nNext, let's try x = 1:\n\n(1)^5 + 3(1)^3 + (1)^2 + 2(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7\n\nSince 7 is not equal to 0 in Z_5, x = 1 is not a zero of the polynomial.\n\nNext, let's try x = 2:\n\n(2)^5 + 3(2)^3 + (2)^2 + 2(2) = 32 + 24 + 4 + 4 = 64\n\nSince 64 is not equal to 0 in Z_5, x = 2 is not a zero of the polynomial.\n\nNext, let's try x = 3:\n\n(3)^5 + 3(3)^3 + (3)^2 + 2(3) = 243 + 81 + 9 + 6 = 339\n\nSince 339 is not equal to 0 in Z_5, x = 3 is not a zero of the polynomial.\n\nFinally, let's try x = 4:\n\n(4)^5 + 3(4)^3 + (4)^2 + 2(4) = 1024 + 192 + 16 + 8 = 1240\n\nSince 1240 is not equal to 0 in Z_5, x = 4 is not a zero of the polynomial.\n\nHowever, we can try x = 4 + 1 = 5, which is not in Z_5, but we can try x = 4 + 0 = 4, which is in Z_5, but we already tried that.
